Mordred
=================

Mordred is a research prototype of a heterogeneous CPU-GPU DBMS engine.
The work was presented at VLDB '22. Please read the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3551793.3551809) for more details.

Usage
----

*Dependencies:
```
Ubuntu > 20.04
GCC > 9.4
CUDA > 11.0
IntelTBB
```

To use Mordred:

To run the Star Schema Benchmark implementation:

* Generate the test dataset

```
cd test/

# Generate the test generator / transformer binaries
cd ssb/dbgen
make
cd ../loader
make 
cd ../../

# Generate the test data and transform into columnar layout
# Substitute <SF> with appropriate scale factor (eg: 1)
python util.py ssb <SF> gen
python util.py ssb <SF> transform

#Sort the LINEORDER table if you want to enable segment skipping
cd ssb/loader
make sort
./columnSort ../data/s{SF}_columnar/LINEORDER ../data/s{SF}_columnar/LINEORDERSORT 5 16 {COLUMN_SIZE}
```

* Configure the benchmark settings
```
# Edit SF and BASE_PATH in src/gpudb/ssb_utils.h
# Edit SF and BASE_PATH in src/gpudb/common.h
# Edit file path in src/gpudb/minmax.cpp and src/gpudb/minmaxsort.cpp
# Edit SF and table size in minmax.sh (following the size in src/gpudb/ssb_utils.h)
```

* To compile and run Mordred
```
make setup
make bin/gpudb/minmax
make bin/gpudb/minmaxsort
./minmax.sh
make bin/gpudb/main
./bin/gpudb/main
```

When you run Mordred, you would be given the following options:
```
Select Options:
1. Run Specific Query
2. Run Random Queries
3. Run Experiment
4. Replacement
5. Dump Trace
6. Exit
cache. Cache Specific Column
clear. Delete Columns from GPU
custom. Toggle custom malloc
skipping. Toggle segment skipping
```
**Mordred do not cache the data by default**
To populate the cache, select option (2), run 100 random queries (for warm-up), and then select option (4) to populate the cache. 

In option (4), you can input the caching policies from the following options: (1)LFU, (2)LRU, (3)LRU2, (4)LFUSegmented, (5)LRUSegmented, (6)LRU2Segmented, and (7)SemanticAware.
SemanticAware is the novel caching policy introduced in our paper. See Figure 7 in our paper to understand the difference between each policies.

To run individual query, select option (1) and input the ssb query (e.g. input '21' to run q2.1 in SSB).
